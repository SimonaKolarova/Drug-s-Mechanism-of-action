# Drug's Mechanism of action prediction
Predicting the mechanism of action of drugs using gene expression and cell viability data from a publically available dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa).

# CS50 final project - Drug's Mechanism of action prediction

## Personal background and knowledge used
My name is Simona Kolarova, I am recent PhD graduate from King's College London and my area of expertise is physical chemistry. For this project, I drew upon my understanding of chemical and biological dataset and my newly developed passion for data analysis and machine learning. I utilised much of the understanding developed troughout CS50 (specifically, my knowledge of Python, HTML and CSS, data structures and algorithms) and some of the techniques I learned during completion of the CS50 AI course. 

## Project background and aim
Understanding the mechanism of action (MoA) of drug candidates is becoming increasingly important in the process of drug discovery. To determine the MoA of newly-developed therapeutics, cell-based assays that measure gene expression and cell viability upon drug exposure are commonly employed in combination with large databases of known drug/cellular responses/MoA correlations. Predicting the MoA of drug candidates from such data requires robust data analysis and machine learning approaches.

In search of such approaches, the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH), Connectivity Map (a project within the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard) and the NIH Common Funds Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) recently made a [large multi-label dataset of cellular responses and MoA](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa) publicly available.

To contribute to this important task, I explored and visualised important aspects of the provided dataset and constructed a neural network model in Python and described my project in detail in an HTML file (available here: )

## Dataset - understanding and visualisation
First, I focused on understanding the different features (i.e., experimental conditions, gene expressions, cell viabilities) and the target (i.e., mechanisms of action) in the dataset. For the purpose I visualised their distributions and calculated their cross-correlations in this [Jupiter Notebook](). More information available in [HTML project description]().

## Exploratory data anaysis
Next, I examined the relationships between the different features (e.g., whether experimental conditions affect the overall gene expression and cell viabilities) and the relationships between the features and the targets(e.g., whether disproportional loss of cell viability is correlated with a drug having multiple mechanisms of action). 
Again, I compiled a [Jupiter Notebook](), where I performed all required data handling and provide much more information in the [HTML project description]().

# Drug's Mechanism of action prediction
Predicting the mechanism of action of drugs using gene expression and cell viability data from a publicly available dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa).

## Project background and aim
Understanding the mechanism of action (MoA) of drug candidates is becoming increasingly important in the process of drug discovery. To determine the MoA of newly-developed therapeutics, cell-based assays that measure gene expression and cell viability upon drug exposure are commonly employed in combination with large databases of known drug/cellular responses/MoA correlations. Predicting the MoA of drug candidates from such data requires robust data analysis and machine learning approaches.

In search of such approaches, the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH), Connectivity Map (a project within the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard) and the NIH Common Funds Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) recently made a [large multi-label dataset of cellular responses and MoA](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa) publicly available.

To contribute to this task, I explored and visualised important aspects of the provided dataset, constructed a neural network model in Python and described my project in detail in an HTML file.
